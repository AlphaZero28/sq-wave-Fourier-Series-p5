# sq-wave-Fourier-Series-p5
The Fourier series states that every signal may be represented by adding the appropriate epicycles. In this repository, a square wave was generated using 50 epicyles. In order to identify suitable epiclyses before implementation, a square wave's Fourier series analysis was done.
